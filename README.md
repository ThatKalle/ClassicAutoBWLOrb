# ClassicAutoBWLOrb

Upon interaction with the [Orb of Command](https://classic.wowhead.com/object=179879/orb-of-command) in Blackrock Spire the addon will automatically enter the [Blackwing Lair](https://classic.wowhead.com/blackwing-lair) raid instance. *If attuned and in a raid party*

## Installation

Make sure the folder is named `ClassicAutoBWLOrb` in your `Interface\AddOns` folder. If you download the master branch from GitHub it will add `-master` to the folder name.
